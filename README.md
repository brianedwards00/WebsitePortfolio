# Website Portfolio

## What is this?
Simply put, I created a website application that displays my portfolio. [My website](https://brianedwards00.github.io/WebsitePortfolio/) was created from scratch through React. You will find the code to my website in this repository.

## How To Install Project on Your Computer
#### Prerequisites 
First things first, I am assuming that you are using a Ubuntu command line, or a familiar Linux one at the least <br/>
On the command line, run the following to install the necessary coding language and package manager:
- `sudo apt-get install yarn`
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `yarn install`

#### Install Project
On the command line, find a path to put the project in, then run the following in order:
- `git clone https://github.com/brianedwards00/WebsitePortfolio.git`

## How to Run
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
#### Available Scripts
You know you are in the project directory on the command line when you run `ls` and you receive <br/>
`flask-backend  node_modules  package.json  public  src  yarn.lock` <br/> <br/>
Here, you can start the front-end in a local environment:
###### `yarn start`
- Runs the front-end (what the users see)
- Opens [http://localhost:3000/WebsitePortfolio](http://localhost:3000/WebsitePortfolio) to view it in the browser.

## Future Work
